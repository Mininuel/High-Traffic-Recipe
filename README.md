Recipe Site Traffic Prediction

This project is part of a practical data science task for predicting whether a recipe will generate high traffic when featured on the homepage of the Tasty Bytes website.

#......Project Objective...

To help the product team decide which recipes to feature by building a classification model that predicts recipe popularity. The goal is to correctly identify high-traffic recipes at least 80% of the time, thereby increasing user engagement and subscription rates.

#........Data Source......

Dataset: recipe_site_traffic_2212.csv
Each record contains:

Recipe ID

Nutritional information (calories, carbs, sugar, protein)

Category

Number of servings

High traffic label


#......Workflow.....

1. Data Validation

Cleaned and validated all columns

Checked for missing, inconsistent, or anomalous values



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions of individual variables

Explored relationships between variables and the target (high_traffic)



3. Model Development

Defined it as a binary classification problem

Built a baseline model (e.g., Logistic Regression)

Developed comparison models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest)



4. Model Evaluation

Compared models using appropriate classification metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)

Selected the model that best met the 80% accuracy requirement



5. Business Metric

Defined a performance metric for monitoring recipe popularity

Provided an initial benchmark based on historical data



6. Recommendations

Actionable insights for the product team

Model deployment considerations and future improvement ideas




#......Deliverables.......

Written Report: Full analysis, findings, and recommendations

Presentation: 8–10 slide summary prepared for the product team

Code Notebook: Fully commented code in a DataLab/Notebook environment


#.....Tools Used......

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter/Datacamp Datalab

CSV data analysis and visualization
